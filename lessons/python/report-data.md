title: Working with Report Data (Excel or Director's Station)
---

## Opening

Librarians often find themselves working with spreadsheets, in particular,
Excel files.  Excel is the most popular spreadsheet software.  Spreadsheets
are designed to store and analyze tabular or categorized data.  Librarians
also use a tool called Director's Station that allows creation of 
reports of library data.

While these two tools can be useful, there are some limitations

- They often require repetative tasks to be performed in creation of reports
- They cost money to purchase licenses
- A librarian may need to learn two sets of skills - one for Excel, one
 for Director's station - to perform very similar tasks

By coupling learning how to program in a general-purpose language like Python 
with an understanding of how data is stored, a librarian can learn to automate
tasks to save time and to overcome new obstacles they
discover in either Excel, Director's Station or any other software tool.

The rest of this chapter will explore how to use Python to manipulate
library-related data.  We acknowledge that not all librarians use the same
tools, but we have designed this lessons to be as general as possible.

## A simple example

Consider a the following data as an example of a spreadsheet that a librarian
may find themself working with.

Eventually, we will get to the point where can know how many holds 
there are on Ender's Game.

Here is the data of the above spreadsheet exported as [CSV file](../../data/librarians/simple.csv).
